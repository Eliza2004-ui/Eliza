	      <p>This was last summer vacation when my friend and I made an appointment to go camping. The weather was very hot, the journey was also very far, and the destination was very remote. My friend and I walked for a long time to arrive. But we had a great time, we bought some ingredients from the boss and barbecued ourselves. At night, as the temperature dropped and the sun set, we took some photos to record the beauty of the day.</p>
	      <p class="FitImage"><img src="images/2.jpg" width="1171" height="450" alt=""/>This is a photo of me and my mother and brother going to the amusement park to play together. There are many game facilities in the amusement park, and we all enjoy the fun of playing there. We played many projects and tasted the delicious food in the amusement park, but the only drawback is that the food inside is too expensive. Time passes quickly in the amusement park, and we have a happy day.</p>
	      <p class="FitImage"><img src="images/4.jpg" width="1171" height="450" alt=""/>On this day, our family chose a good weather to go out for a barbecue. The sunshine was just right, and we prepared sufficient ingredients. My brother also participated in the barbecue process, and he thought it was a very interesting thing to exercise his hands-on skills. With everyone's efforts, everyone has tasted delicious food. After finishing our meal, we sang again, bought some drinks, and had a fulfilling day. Everyone felt both tired and happy.</p>
		  <p class="FitImage"><img src="images/5.jpg" width="1168" height="450" alt=""/>This is my good friend Vicky. We met in high school and have known each other for three years. She is an interesting and generous girl who is tolerant of friends in many things and does not haggle over details. She shares good things with me and provides help in many aspects. Although sometimes naive, this does not affect her image in my heart. For the past three years, we have helped each other and experienced many difficulties, but also had many happy memories. In the following days, I hope we can continue to walk forward.</p>
