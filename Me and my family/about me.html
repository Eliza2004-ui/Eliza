	    <h1 class="text-center">Welcom To Elizaâ€˜s Website</h1>
	    <p class="text-center">This website will showcase about me and my family</p>
	    <p class="FitImage"><img src="images/1.jpg"  alt=""/>
	      <p>My hobbies are very broad, play badminton, climbing mountains, painting and listening to music, among which painting is my favorite. Since kindergarten, I have been fond of painting on white paper. I like the feeling of filling it with a brush, which gives me a great sense of achievement. I envy others for having good works. I have browsed many people's paintings, and everyone has their own unique style. I also hope to have my own style, so I will always adhere to my goals and keep striving.</p>
	      <p class="FitImage"><img src="images/6.jpg"  alt=""/>On weekends, I usually choose to relax myself. I enjoy watching TV dramas, and in my free time, I choose some suspense dramas to watch. I enjoy the process of exploring the truth. I will also go mountain climbing. My family and I usually go mountain climbing together after dinner. Mountain climbing can exercise and strengthen leg muscles, make leg muscles developed and improve flexibility, increase vital capacity, and improve cardiopulmonary function.</p>
	      <p><img src="images/5.jpg" alt=""/>I am currently studying art at Ningbo Foreign Affairs School. I am a person who enjoys making friends and I feel both introverted and outgoing. I am sometimes silent and sometimes lively.
The skills I currently possess include some of the professional skills I have learned, computer knowledge, and speaking some English.
Through some understanding, the work of graphic designer is relatively stable and the income is relatively stable. The higher the design talent is, the more substantial the income is. There is no restriction on its development space. As long as it has excellent graphic design skills, it can have its own space in any company.But first of all, I need to have enough ability to become a graphic designer. Now I don't have enough ability and knowledge. I need to improve myself through continuous learning and reading materials. Only by adhering to the combination of practice and learning, can I be qualified to become a graphic designer.</p>
